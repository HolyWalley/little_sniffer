# Little Sniffer
It's like [Sniffer](https://github.com/aderyabin/sniffer), but not global.

LittleSniffer aims to help:

  * Watch for needed http requests (request groups) and passing their raw data to provided handler. It doesn't store data!

Sniffer supports only [Net::HTTP](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.4.2/libdoc/net/http/rdoc/Net/HTTP.html) for now, however PR's are welcomed


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'little_sniffer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install little_sniffer

## Usage

Here's some simple examples to get you started:

```ruby
require 'net/http'
require 'little_sniffer'

handler = proc { |data| puts data }

LittleSniffer.new(handler: handler) do
  Net::HTTP.get(URI('http://example.com/?lang=ruby&author=matz'))
end
